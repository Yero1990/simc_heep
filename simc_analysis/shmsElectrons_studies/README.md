SHMS Electrons Studies
=======================

**This directory contains simulations for H(e,e'p) elastics taken 
  during E12-10-003 experiment. 

**The main goal is to study the shifts in W observed between data and SIMC
  and determine the correct momentum correction factor to get data W to
  align with SIMC.

**It is assumed for now, that any shift in W is caused only by the spectrometer
  momentum setting. Since the angle and beam energy were obtained from camera 
  and beam energy studies respectively.
