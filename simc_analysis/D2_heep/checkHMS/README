 Check HMS Momentum Using H(e,e'p) Elastics
********************************************

Purpose: 
Check if HMS momentum (+polarity) is set correctly, and verify there are no
correlations between the (calculated - measured)/measured  momentum vs. HMS focal plane
A total of five elastics taken during Deuteron Electro-Disintegration are used in these studies.


Approach:
For both SIMC and DATA, determine the HMS calculated momentum, P_calc(Eb, theta_p), assuming 
the beam energy and angle are well known. Then determine the fractional deviation of
measured momentum both from SIMC/DATA by using the formula:

dP =  [P_calc - P_meas] / P_meas, |  where P_calc = 2*Mp*Eb*(Eb+Mp)*cos(theta_p) / ( Mp^2 + 2*Mp*Eb + Eb^2*sin^2(theta_p) )
                                  |  and P_meas is obtained from delta (both in SIMC and DATA).  delta = (P - P_cent) / P_cent

** The dP will be a distribution centered near zero, which can then be fitted, to determine the mean, and its error.

Since the calculated momentum has no dependence on delta, by taking the difference [P_calculated - P_meas.]/P_meas, one 
is able to gauge by how much is the measured momentum off from the calculated momentum, due to delta. For SIMC, this difference was found to be
typically < 0.1 %, which is very small as expected. For data, however, it was found to be > 0.1% for some elastics, so a correction to the 
momentum was applied in the std. kin file from data was applied, and was also applied to the SIMC input file. This resulted in dP < 0.1% for data as well.
Then, the difference between SIMC and DATA, (dP_simc - dP_data) was calculated, and the result was < 0.1% .

Once this was done, the fractional momentum deviation dP vs. HMS focal plane in SIMC and DATA was plotted, to check for any correlations.
Any correlations could possibly distort the fit of dP, as the dP distribution would NOT be symmetric. This could distort the peak in dP, which
can cause the momentum correction to be distorted as well. Therefore, it is important to remove any possible correlations first.

For these studies, no correlations were found in dP vs HMS (xfp, yfp, xpfp, ypfp) in the data, which gave us confidence that the momentum corrections 
determined had not been distorted.
