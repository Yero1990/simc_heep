Study Observed Delta Shift  --December 04, 2018
**************************

A shift in delta between SIMC and data was observed. The same
shift was observed for calculated momentum (Eb, theta_p)

From the pCalc_mean value:   data = 2.914,   simc = 2.923,  diff = 9e-3 (9 MeV)

From the derivatives,  dth_p =  dP / (dP / dth_p ).  For dP = 9e-3 GeV
the variation in proton angle is: dth_p = -0.00122141 radians

STEPTS TAKEN:

** Apply yptar offset in hms_flags.param  (shifter yptar, but NOT delta, as delta does NOT depend on it)

** Comparing Pcalc_data and Pcalc_simc, now they agree, as data shifted towards simc  

** Comparing (Pcalc_data - Pmeas_data)/Pmeas_data, now is further from SIMC, given that only Pcalc_data
   changed,  so the HMS momentum must be corrected for.


To determine the momentum correection factor, look at the plot: DATA_SIMC_hmsP_Diff.pdf
This plot shows (DATA - SIMC), which tells us by how much data deviates from simc in fraction.
For example, if (DATA - SIMC) = 0.0031, then DATA calc momentum is 0.31 % larger than it should be, so to compensate, DATA measured momentum should also increase
So, P_corr = P - 0.0031*P = P*(1 + 0.0031) = P*1.0031

After correcting for the HMS momentum, hYptar and hDelta have better agreement between DATA/SIMC. As a result, data Emiss(hmsP, Eb, E') seems to have shifted 'left' too much. Since the
HMS is understood now, the shift must be coming from either the beam energy or electron momentum. The problem is that shifting electron momentum, E', will shift W as well, which currently looks OK. Therefore, the shift in E' will need to be compensated with a shift in electron angle, yptar. A derivative dW/dth_e and dW/dE' must be used.
