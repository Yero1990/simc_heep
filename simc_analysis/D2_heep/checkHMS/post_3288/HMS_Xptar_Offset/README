 HMS Xptar Offset
******************

January 18, 2018
There is an offset observed between DATA/SIMC in HMS xptar.
This offset can be estimated by comparing the mean of the 
xptar distributions. This would then be applied to data.

The SIMC/DATA HMS Xptar was normalized and compared. Black is DATA.  RED is SIMC.
