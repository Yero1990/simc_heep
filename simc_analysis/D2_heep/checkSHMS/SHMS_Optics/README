Fitting the SHMS Optics 
************************

**Plotting (shms_cal_delta - shms_meas_delta) vs. SHMS focal plane quantities,
there appears to be correlations across the focal plane. To remove these
correlations, a 5-D fit of xfp, yfp, xpfp, ypfp and P_cent need to be done
on the data. Before this fit is done, a TGraphical Cut needs to be applied on 
each of the correlations observed, to select only those events of interest.


Apply Graphical Cuts:
** Run the code: set_cuts.C  

This code reads in the histogram objects (created by calc_pElec_PDiff_v2.C) and the user can 
make polygon cuts on the graph. This graphs are stored as  ' *_cut.root* ' which are then read 
by the code fitOptics.C  


Code: fitOptics.C 

Description: This code calculates the (delta_calc - delta_meas) vs. focal plane times and
other relevant quatities. The root file containing the graphical cuts are read in, and the
cuts are applied when filling the matrix to do the fitting. All 5 D2 elastics are used to fit
the data simultaneously, as each of these runs covers different regions of the focal plane, which 
we want to correct their correlations with delta. 

Once the fit is done, another loop over the runs is made in which the matrix correction factors are read in
and a fit function is calculated per events from these factors. The fit fucntion is then subtracted from the
correlations observerd, to check whether the correlations were removed. Then, once determined that the coefficients
are working (removed correlations), the coefficients can be put in the actual matrix file, and the data replayed once more.



Optics matrix format:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
xptar           ytar           yptar            delta                                                                 
0.277714223    -0.046726452    0.0303003269     0.667153399 01000
----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                          0    1      0    0     0 
The five digits to the right represent:  xfp, x'fp,  yfp, y'fp, xtar

The 0: means the term is raied to the zero power
The 1: means the term is raied to the 1st  power
and so on . . .

Since this system is initially, over-determined (More equations than unknowns), one of the target variables, xtar (horizontal target pos)
is fixed, beforehand. 

The coefficinets under each of the first four columns represent focal plane quantities coefficients. For example, if only a delta optimization is
used, then, the file would look like:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
!xptar           ytar           yptar            delta                                                                 
0.00000000       0.00000000     0.00000000       0.667153399 00000
0.00000000       0.00000000     0.00000000      -0.535358399 10000
0.00000000       0.00000000     0.00000000        0.84346399 01000
0.00000000       0.00000000     0.00000000       -0.27153399 00100
0.00000000       0.00000000     0.00000000       1.367153399 00010

delta = D0 + D1*xfp + D2*xpfp + D3*yfp + D4*ypfp,   where D0 = 0.667153399, and so on . . .

There may even be cross terms, like 11000, which represents ----> Coefficient * xfp * xpfp, for example, since the focal plane variables
can be correlated within themselves.
