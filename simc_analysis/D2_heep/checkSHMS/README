 Check SHMS Momentum Using H(e,e'p) Elastics
********************************************

Purpose: 
Check if SHMS momentum (-polarity) is set correctly, and verify there are no
correlations between the (calculated - measured)/measured  momentum vs. SHMS focal plane
A total of five elastics taken during Deuteron Electro-Disintegration are used in these studies.

Approach:
For both SIMC and DATA, determine the SHMS calculated momentum (using electron momentum formula), P_calc(Eb, hmsP_meas), assuming 
the beam energy and measured HMS momentum are well known. (See ../checkHMS directory, where the HMS proton momentum was verified to be OK )
Then determine the fractional deviation of measured momentum both from SIMC/DATA by using the formula:

dP =  [P_calc - P_meas] / P_meas, |  where P_calc = Eb + Mp - Ep,  Ep = sqrt(Mp^2 + hmsP_meas^2).  P_calc ~ E_calc for electrons (elec mass is small)
                                  |  and P_meas is obtained from delta (both in SIMC and DATA).  delta_calc = (P_calc - P_cent) / P_cent, delta_meas = (P_meas - P_cent) / P_cent   

(NOTE that P_calc and P_meas are esentially the same as delta_calc and delta_meas. For optics studies, usually, delta is preferred.)

** The dP will be a distribution centered near zero, which can then be fitted, to determine the mean, and its error. (Assuming there are no distortions correlations with  respect to focal plane variables)
                                                                                                                     
Similarly to the HMS case, since the calculated momentum has no dependence on delta, by taking the difference [P_calculated - P_meas.]/P_meas, one 
is able to gauge by how much is the measured momentum off from the calculated momentum, due to delta. For SIMC, this difference was found to be
typically < 0.1 %, which is very small as expected. For data, however, it was found to be > 0.1% for some elastics. In this case, it was not possible to apply
a momentum correction in the SHMS, as the dP distribution was distorted in the data, due to correlations of delta with focal plane quantities. Therefore, it is necessary
to remove these correlations first, then check whether the dP agress with SIMC to < 0.1 %. If after the optimizing the SHMS optics matrix (removing correlations), it still 
does not agree, then we can do the same procedure as HMS, and apply a correction.
