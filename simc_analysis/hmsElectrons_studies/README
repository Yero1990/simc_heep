HMS Electrons Studies
***********************

Brief: This directory contains SIMC macros/plots/root_files relevant to
the H(e,e'p) studies done on HMS with electrons. The Dec/Spring 2018
Hall C H-elastics data has beem summarized in a kinematic files, and the
W peak position determined from a fit. 

The elastics from HMS electrons kinematics file was also simulated in this
repository. The simulation was with NO rad_corr or energy_loss corrections,
since the data does NOT correct for these as well, the energy loss and
radiation was simulated though. 

The W-peak from simulation and data will be compared to determine what is
the source of the shift. It could be beam energy, spec_angle or momentum
offsets.
