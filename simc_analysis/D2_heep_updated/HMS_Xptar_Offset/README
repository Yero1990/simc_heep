 HMS Xptar Offset
******************

January 09, 2018
There is an offset observed between DATA/SIMC in HMS xptar.
This offset can be estimated by comparing the mean of the 
xptar distributions. This would then be applied to data.

The SIMC/DATA HMS Xptar was normalized and compared. Black is DATA.  RED is SIMC.
Run    data_mean   simc_mean    simc-data
3288  
3371   
3374   
3377   

Average Diff. =  () / 4 =  radians

The offset of hxptar was applied in the DEUTERON_ANALYSIS/PARAM/HMS/GEN/hms_flags.param
