 HMS Xptar Offset
******************

January 04, 2018
There is an offset observed between DATA/SIMC in HMS xptar.
This offset can be estimated by comparing the mean of the 
xptar distributions. This would then be applied to data.

The SIMC/DATA HMS Xptar was normalized and compared. Black is DATA.  RED is SIMC.
Run    data_mean   simc_mean    simc-data
3288   -0.001306   0.0004634    0.001769
3371   -0.001540   0.0009274    0.002467
3374   -0.001763   0.0006616    0.002425
3377   -0.002403   0.0008867    0.003290

Average Diff. =  (0.001769 + 0.002467 + 0.002425 +  0.003290) / 4 = 0.002488 radians

The offset of hxptar was applied in the DEUTERON_ANALYSIS/PARAM/HMS/GEN/hms_flags.param
