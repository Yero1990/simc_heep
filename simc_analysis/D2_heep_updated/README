Updated Heep Studies

It was found that the calibrated BPM positions were NOT being used.
So it was determine that the Heep check should be done again.
In terms of the delta optimization that was done before, Mark said it would NOT
be affected, as it only removed correlations observed between deltaDiff and focal plane quantities.

Since Emiss and W alignment have to be done again, it is easier to do 50 k replays on
runs 3288, 3371, 3374, 3377  (3376 was at the same kinematics as 3377, much lower statistics, so it will be ignored)

The starting central momentum values will be those of the previous heep check done. 
---> Check W/Emiss between DATA/SIMC and determine whether it needs correction
---> Once the correction is done, determine the NMR to momentum map, (hopefully is a line fit)

The momentum range covered by the heep check covers all momenta in the detuteron experiment, so the fit can be
used to extract the correct momentum corresponding to NMR value.

An HMS Xptar offset was determined, and corrected first.

Then, the W alignment was done, as this only depends on the electron arm.

Finally, the Emiss alignment was done, as this would only depend on proton arm, (since W alignment was done, and electron momentum corrected)

The (calculate - measured)/measured HMS momentum was determined for DATA/SIMC and the difference taken to check the HMS Momentum. Even though the 
Emiss and W were aligned and look OK, if one tries to make the momwntum difference smaller, Emiss will NOT be aligne anymore. Why is this?
