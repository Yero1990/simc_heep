**********************
Collimator Cut Study
**********************

May 1, 2019

Motivation: In estimating the data/simc yield by integrating W over a certain
            range (0.85, 1.05),  it was found that making a Missing Energy Cut,
	    of say, < 40 MeV to cut out the radiative tail, also  cut out events
	    in the main W peak for data, but NOT for simc. This caused the data
	    yield to be artificially lower than it should be. This means that
	    events with large missing energy were reconstructed at the W peak,
	    and in a W vs. Emiss plot, this would show up as a horizontal (or
	    uncorrelated) band which was present in data but NOT in simc.
	    A collimator cut would eliminate this band, and a missing energy
	    cut would therefore have no effect in the main W peak as it should.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Previous Observations: 
   	   A yield ratio of ~95% for run 3288 was achieved by placing the following cuts:
	   abs(h_delta)<8%,  e_delta: (-10, 22)%   c_esolid=abs(e_xptar)<0.026&&abs(e_yptar)<0.015
	   This solid angle cut was to select electrons ONLY, in the SHMS.
	   Werner advises to make collimator cuts as opposed to (x'tar,y'tar) cuts, as these are dynamical cuts on
	   the Z target, whereas the collimator cuts are geometrical cuts, independent of Ztarget
	   
	   The corresponding collimator cuts for this configuration are: abs(eXColl)<6.8&&abs(eYColl)<5. cm


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	   
Plan:  Study the dependence of the data/simc yield on various HMS Collimator cut
       settings,  while keeping relatively loose cut on SHMS Collimator.
       Then do the same for SHMS Collimator.

       SIMC HMS/SHMS Collimator were used as guidance for the cuts, as SIMC simulates 
       ONLY H(e,e'p) events.  Data has other un-wanted reactione which show up beyond the 
       collimator limits.

The starting Cut Values from SIMC are:

HMS Collimator:
    X: (-13, 13) cm
    Y: (-5, 5) cm

The X will be reduced in increments of 1cm.
The Y will be reduced in increments of 0.5 cm.

   e.g.  X1: (-13,13)   Y1: (-5,5)
   	 X2: (-12,12)	Y2: (-4.5,4.5)
	 X3: (-11,11)	Y3: (-4, 4)
	 X4: (-10,10)	Y4: (-3.5,3.5)
	 X5: (-9, 9)    Y5: (-3, 3)

-------------------------------------------------------------

SHMS Collimator:
     X: (-7, 7) cm
     Y: (-5, 5) cm

The X will be reduced in increments of 1cm.
The Y will be reduced in increments of 0.5 cm.

   e.g.  X1: (-7,7)   Y1: (-5,5)
   	 X2: (-6,6)   Y2: (-4.5,4.5)
	 X3: (-5,5)   Y3: (-4, 4)
	 X4: (-4,4)   Y4: (-3.5,3.5)
	 X5: (-3,3)   Y5: (-3, 3)
