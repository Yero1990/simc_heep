The single tracking efficiency was done as follows:

From report file, single_trk_eff = did / should, where
a cut on etotnorm[0.6,1.6] was placed in should, and did was required ntrack==1

** This tracking efficinecy was used in SIMC weight.

** On data, a cut on pdc_ntrack==1 was placed, and the events weighted by
F = ntrack ==1 / ntrack > 0, where each W event was weighted by 1/F
Also, a cut on etotnorm[0.6,1.6] was placed
