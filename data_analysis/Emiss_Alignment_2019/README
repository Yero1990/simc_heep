March 6, 2019:

Aftre looking at the D2 80 MeV setting, we determined that the SHMS momentum
was not correctly set from the "00000" offsets in delta optimization.
It was decided to take out this correction, and the yptar offset, to start from
the point at which the SHMS delta was calibrated. 

** From this point, we checked HMS momentum again (Pcala-Pmeas) and it seems OK.

** Then we assumed that the difference in Emiss between DATA/SIMC was attributed to the SHMS e' momentum.

** Then, E'corr = E' + dE',  where dE' = -dEm,  dEm = Em_simc - Em_data

** Then, it was noticed that W was still not aligned. The SHMS momentum was checked to make sure it was NOT the cause of this offset.
   We assume that offset was then dues to the spectrometer angle not being well determined (NOT yptar, as we had corrected for in the past).
   As, when we take dW / dth, it is derivative with respect to spectrometer central angle, and therfore,
   the central angle must be corrected. The yptar corrections still needs to be determined. 


To follow the sequence of these studies in orders, from the current directory:

1) cd EmAlign/before    --> to see the Un-Aligned Emiss plots
2) cd HMS_Pcheck/       --> to see the hms momentum is trusted (data/simc comparison)
3) cd EmAlign/after     --> to see the aligned Emiss after correcting for SHMS momentum 
      			    (the fit to Emiss and txt file with the Emiss offsets 
			    applied as shms correction can be found in EmAlign/before)
4) cd SHMS_Pcheck       --> See plots indicating SHMS momentum is understood after Em alignment.
5) cd shmsAngleOffset   --> See plots indicating W is aligned after correcting SHMS central angle.
