** Yesterday,  the HMS momentum was checked to verify that the Emiss 
   shift observed was NOT due to HMS, but rather entirely to SHMS central 
   momentum.

** The Emiss was then fitted, and a difference taken and plotted vs. run
   The data was NOT entirely linear, see .png figure in this directory,
   so an average of all four points was taken as the overall shift 
   in Emiss. (We are talking about ~ 1 MeV difference between different 
   elastic runs, so maybe this approximation is OK)
