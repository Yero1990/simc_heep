** After applying the Emiss offset to correct the SHMS momentum, now the
Emiss in all four runs appear aligned.  The W, however, still appearas a little offset.

** To verify that the SHMS momentum was NOT the cause of this W offset, 
   the calculated - measured momentum was plotted. See ../../SHMS_Pcheck/
   The fractional momentum difference between data/simc was < 0.5 %

** This indicates that the shift in W is entirely due to the SHMS central angle 
   being a little offset. The offsets were determined by fitting W, and 
   using the derivative dW/dth_e. See directory ../../shmsAngleOffset
