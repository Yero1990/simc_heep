SHMS Delta Optimization
************************

March 10, 2019

The original optimization of shms delta before seemed to work for the H(e,e'p) elastics
but NOT for the 80 MeV setting. As the Emiss in 80 MeV seemed NOT aligned.
In this procedure, the shms delta was optimized, and then EMiss was aligned to obtain the
momentum offset.  Now, we will invert the procedure.

Alternate Method:

1) Determine the SHMS momentum correction from the Emiss alignment of the delta = 0 elastic
   run coincidence 3288. [Using the original Non-Optimized SHMS Matrix] 
    Apply this single correction to the remaining elastic runs. 

2) Fit the SHMS delta matrix ONLY using the xfp / x'fp 1st and 2nd order terms. Mark
   suspects that there migh be a ytar/yptar dependence that should NOT be corrected for
   in the 80 MeV setting.
