SHMS Delta Re-Optimization
***************************

A momentum correction was found from optimization, as the 00000 term in the matrix.
In the befor / after directories are the SIMC/DATA comparisons without / with this
momentum correction applied both to data and simc.

The correction was: E'corr = E'* 0.999548 for all heep runs
