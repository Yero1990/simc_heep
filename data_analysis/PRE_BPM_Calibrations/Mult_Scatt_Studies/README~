*****************************
SIMC Additional Mult. Scatt, 
Smearing Studies
*****************************

Effects on additional multiple scattering and smearing in SIMC are studied.

The additional flags used are:
     mc_smear_addl = T          !  Additional Smearing
     recon_mc_smear_addl = T    !  Smearing done on reconstructed variables Ytar, Xptar, Yptar, Delta                                                                                  


     The parameters used in the input file are:
     
     **mc_smear_addl = T  
     spec%e%sig_musc  = 1.0e-6, 1.0e-6                 ! add extra mult scatt. in e Arm  (The two values are sig1 and sig2 from two gaussians used)               
     spec%p%sig_musc  = 1.0e-6, 1.0e-6                 ! add extra mult scatt in pArm       
    
     **recon_mc_smear_addl = T
     spec%e%sig_smear = 1.0e-6, 1.0e-6, 1.0e-6, 1.0e-6                 !add extra smear. in recon eArm (Ytar, xptar, yptar, delta)                                           
     spec%p%sig_smear = 1.0e-6, 1.0e-6, 1.0e-6, 1.0e-6                 !add extra smear. in  recon pArm        

     The studies consist of varying each of the individual parameters, and observing any changes in DATA/SIMC comparisons
     A staring value of 1.0e-6 was used, and is defined as NO SMEARING (Effects are OFF)

     Directory Structure:
     --> target_smearing (mc_smear_addl = T)
         --> no smear (sig1 = 1.0e-6,  sig2 = 1.0e-6)
         --> eArm_sig1 (sig1 = 1.0e-3,  sig2 = 1.0e-6)   : Made SIMC W and X a little worse than expected 
	 --> eArm_sig2 (sig1 = 1.0e-6,  sig2 = 1.0e-3)   : Improved Pmiss (W, X and other KIn. remained same)       *** Good Candidate for later Use
	 --> eArm_sig1and2 (sig1 = 1.0e-3,  sig2 = 1.0e-3)  : Improves Pmiss (W, X, Emiss and other Kin. look worse)
    

	 --> pArm_sig1 (sig1 = 1.0e-3,  sig2 = 1.0e-6)   :   No Changes observed                                                                              
         --> pArm_sig2 (sig1 = 1.0e-6,  sig2 = 1.0e-3)   :   No Changes observed
         --> pArm_sig1and2 (sig1 = 1.0e-3,  sig2 = 1.0e-3)  : No Changes obsevred                                                                    
       

       Same pArm studies were done with sig = 1.0e-1 and it severely affected SHMS focal plane, and HMS/SHMS deltas, and other quantities **SHould NOT use sig 1.0e-1

Notice I added a 7.5e-4 smearing for recon. momenta (in the input file it is in %) and a 2 mr smearing for the xptar and yptar. The Em spectra for hydrogen are only 
sensitive to the reconstructed momenta but not the angles (have a look in the code (event.f) where they are calculated) while W and Em and Pm depend on the angles as 
well and they show a much larger sensitivity.  This will again be a bit different in D(eeâ€™p) as there the recoiling energy increases with pm and its effect on Em will increase. 
You need also be sure that you use the correct cosy calculations in the simulation (check sharing/transp.f etc.) . (the red lines in the attached plots are those with the 
additional smearing)
