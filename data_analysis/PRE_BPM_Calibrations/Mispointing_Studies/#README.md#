Observation: A mis-match between DATA/SIMC z-vertex was observed. This quantity depends on Spectrometer
Ytar mispointing and beam offsets (which are equivalent to Ytar mispointing.

Run 3288 was analyzed with and without beam/mispointing offsets.  

DATA Observations: Without any offstes, SHMS Ytar appeared centerd at zero, as well as beam_x offset.
With SHMS Y Mispointing offset and BMP X Offset:

SHMS Ytar ---> Shifted spectrometer beam right ('-' Ytar values)
BPM X ------> Shifted hall beam right (also equivalently '-' Ytar values)  (Assuming this is in EPICS Coordinate System)

This is consistent with the overall 

This is contradictory to the SHMS X BPM sign given in hcana (which supposedly is in BPM Coordinate System)
