SHMS Offsets
*************

Brief: SHMS Angle offsets "xptar_offset and yptar offset" are studied.
       After Correcting for HMS momentum, Optimizing SHMS delta and 
       aligning Emiss peak between data/simc, to fine tune SHMS elec momentum,
       W still appears a little off.

       Recall: W -> W(Eb, E', th_e)

       If the electron momentum and beam energy are assumed to be well known,
       then only th_e could cause the observed W shift. In this case,

       dW /dth_e = - 2 * Eb * E' * sin(th_e/2) * cos(th_e/2) / Mp

       where dW = W_simc - W_data   (obtained from mean of W fits)
       
       Where one can solve for dth_e, which is the eyptar_offset


As an alternate method to determine this offset, one can use the formula:
       
       Eb = Pp * cos(th_p) + E'*cos(th_e_calc), where E' and th_p and Pp are event-by-event

       Pp: proton measured momentum H.gtr.p
       th_p: proton scattering angle
       E': electron measured momentum P.gtr.p
       th_e_calc: calculated electron momentum

       Solving for th_e_calc:   th_e_calc =  arc-cos [ (Eb - Pp * cos(th_p))/E' ]

       Finally, one can look at: (th_e_calc - th_e_meas), to determine the angle offset from the mean
       This should be equivalent to the method using dW / dth_e

Method 1:  dW /dth_e derivative:
           The root files containing thw histogram objects with the final momentum correction in the SHMS is
	   located in: ../shms_DeltaOptimized/final_SHMS_Momentum/

	   --> Fit the W peak between data/simc. The difference must be DUE to the angle offset.
	   --> Use the python script to estimate the angle variation, dth_e  

Method 2:  (Calculated - Measured) angle difference
       	   The formula for the calculated angle is used and compared to measured angle to determine the offset.
