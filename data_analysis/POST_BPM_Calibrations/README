Updated Heep Studies
*********************

It was found that the calibrated BPM positions were NOT being used.
So it was determine that the Heep check should be done again.
In terms of the delta optimization that was done before, Mark said it would NOT
be affected, as it only removed correlations observed between deltaDiff and focal plane quantities.

The starting central momentum values will be those of EPICS. 
---> Check W/Emiss between DATA/SIMC and determine whether it needs correction
---> Once the correction is done, determine the NMR to momentum map, (hopefully is a line fit)

The momentum range covered by the heep check covers all momenta in the detuteron experiment, so the fit can be
used to extract the correct momentum corresponding to NMR value.

***** IMPORTANT: Check xptar/yptar SIMC/DATA comparisons FIRST, and make sure no offsets are required ***

HMS Electrons Cross-Check
---------------------------

Directory: /data_analysis/HMS_ELECTRONS

** Kinematic groups g1, g2, g3, g4, g6 and g10 were selected to have additional checks on the HMS momentum.
   These runs were taken at 3-pass, except one (5-pass). These runs were ep elastics with HMS electrons.
   The average BPMs were taken from the ttree H.rb.* leafs, and MisPointings from REPORT FILE for SIMC.
   
** The W peaks have been fitted and dW variations found. Also the derivatives of dW/dEb, dW/dE' and dW/dth_e
   were used to determine variations in Eb, E' and th_e that could cause dW. See /data_analysis/HMS_ELECTRONS
   directory, were these studies were done.

Heep Check Steps for Deuteron Data
------------------------------------

** Xptar / Yptar offsets in both arms were set to zero.

** Use the nominal (EPICS) central momenta for both data/simc as staring values.

** Compare DATA / SIMC, and look for any offsets in xptar / yptar consistent throughout the data.  If there are,
   These should be corrected and the data replayed before attempting to correct for spectrometer momentum.

** Determine HMS momentum corr. factor  minimizing (Pcalc - Pmeas) / Pmeas between data and SIMC. (Look in /checkHMS directory)

** Now that we have confidence in HMS momentum setting, look at the SHMS xptar/yptar distributons for any possible offsets.
   Correct for these, before attempting to align W.

** Once all align SHMS W peak to determine the SHMS momentum correction. This
should take care of the Emiss alignment as Emiss (Eb, E', Ep), and Eb and Ep (beam and proton) are well known.
