The H(e,e'p) elastics before run 3288 (SHMS Q3 issue), consisted of 
a single kinemtic setting which is that of 3288:

As a staring point for the momentum corrections, I used the
corrections determined post 3288. These were:

gpbeam = 10.6005
gtargmass_amu = 1.00794
hpartmass = 0.938272
ppartmass = 0.00051099
htheta_lab = -37.29    <----- the HMS angle is actually a little different from 3288
ptheta_lab = 12.2      <----- the SHMS angle is also a little different than 3288
hpcentral = 2.9382*0.9969341636
ppcentral = 8.543210

An HMS check verified that the HMS optics were OK. 
The SHMS check revealed that the SHMS delta needed optimization.

After the 1st optimization, the missing energy improved dramatically.  And a SIMC/DATA comparison in /optim1 revealed that
THE HMS delta was OK. However, the missing energy and W were still a bit off.  This indicated that the SHMS central momentum/angle
needed correction. It seems that the issue is arising from the SHMS momentum.

Electron Momentum Correction factor, assuming dW is all due to E':

dW = -Eb / E' * dE'  ---> dE' = -dW * E' / Eb

E'_corr = E' + dE' = E' - dW * E' / Eb =  E' (1 -  dW/Eb),  where dW =  W_simc -W_data

From Optim 1: 
          mean          err
dataEm : -5.78712e-03   3.69258e-05 
simcEm :  4.38368e-03   2.18562e-05

dataW :  9.25519e-01   1.09969e-04 
simcW :  9.43636e-01   1.05211e-04

dW = 9.43636e-01 -  9.25519e-01 = 0.018117 GeV  (~18 MeV)
dE' = -0.018117 * 8.543210 / 10.6005 =  -0.014601  (~14.6 MeV)

dEm = 4.38368e-03 - (-5.78712e-03) = 0.010171  =? dE'  

The discrepancy between dEm and dE' indicates that the SHMS momentum is NOT the only culprit causing shift in W.
Since it only takes ~ 10 MeV correction to align Missing Energy, where does the other correction come in?  It has to
be the electron angle.
