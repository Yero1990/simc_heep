SHMS Delta Optimization

March 10, 2019

The original optimization of shms delta before seemed to work for the H(e,e'p) elastics
but NOT for the 80 MeV setting. As the Emiss in 80 MeV seemed NOT aligned.
In this procedure, the shms delta was optimized, and then EMiss was aligned to obtain the
momentum offset.  Now, we will invert the procedure.

Alternate Method:
