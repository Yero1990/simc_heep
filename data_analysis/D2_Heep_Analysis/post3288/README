Updated Heep Studies

It was found that the calibrated BPM positions were NOT being used.
So it was determine that the Heep check should be done again.
In terms of the delta optimization that was done before, Mark said it would NOT
be affected, as it only removed correlations observed between deltaDiff and focal plane quantities.

The starting central momentum values will be those of EPICS. 
---> Check W/Emiss between DATA/SIMC and determine whether it needs correction
---> Once the correction is done, determine the NMR to momentum map, (hopefully is a line fit)

The momentum range covered by the heep check covers all momenta in the detuteron experiment, so the fit can be
used to extract the correct momentum corresponding to NMR value.

HMS Electrons Cross-Check
---------------------------

Directory: /data_analysis/HMS_ELECTRONS

** Kinematic groups g1, g2, g3, g4, g6 and g10 were selected to have additional checks on the HMS momentum.
   These runs were taken at 3-pass, except one (5-pass). These runs were ep elastics with HMS electrons.
   The average BPMs were taken from the ttree H.rb.* leafs, and MisPointings from REPORT FILE for SIMC.
   
** The W peaks have been fitted and dW variations found. Also the derivatives of dW/dEb, dW/dE' and dW/dth_e
   were used to determine variations in Eb, E' and th_e that could cause dW. See /data_analysis/HMS_ELECTRONS
   directory, were these studies were done. 

------------------------------------
Heep Check Steps for Deuteron Data
------------------------------------

** Xptar / Yptar offsets in both arms were set to zero.

** Use the nominal (EPICS) central momenta for both data/simc as staring values.

** Compare DATA / SIMC, and look for any offsets in xptar / yptar consistent throughout the data.  If there are,
   These should be corrected and the data replayed before attempting to correct for spectrometer momentum.

** Determine HMS momentum corr. factor  minimizing (Pcalc - Pmeas) / Pmeas between data and SIMC. (Look in /checkHMS directory)

** Now that we have confidence in HMS momentum setting, look at the SHMS (delta_calc - delta_meas) vs. focal plane. Fit these correlations
   with 1st / 2nd order terms. The '00000' constant term represents the momentum correction in the SHMS. This constant factor should take care of any
   Emiss (Eb, E', Ep) /  W (Eb, E', th_e) alignment between data/simc. If there are still offets in W, then this is likely attributed to an anlge offset, eyptar.
   If Emiss is NOT aligned, then this is most likely attributed to incorrect Ep (proton momentum correction due to an angle offset hyptar), since Pcalc (Eb, th_p) vs.
   Pmeas. is a little off.

Emain from Mark Jones regarding the "00000" matrix term and Emiss Alignment:
--------------------------------------------
     I thought about it more. Fitting the delta "00000" term and fitting  the pcentral_offset are not the same thing. 
     So we cannot simply switch the delta "00000" term with the pcentral_offset.  Only at delta = 0 does this work. At other 
     delta this does not work and that is why you see emiss at different places. SO there is nothing wrong in hcana.

     What needs to be done is replay the runs using pcentral_offset that is equal to the delta "00000" term. Now the emiss 
     will not line up for the different runs which are at different delta. at delta=0 the emiss should match SIMC emiss.
     Redo the matrix fit without the "00000" term.  THis should get the emiss peaks to line up and you have the proper pcentral_offset.

---------------------------------------------

	The procedure to align Emiss is as follows: 

	    * Use the "00000" term from the 1st SHMS delta Optimization as 'ppcentral_offset' in shmsflags.param (NOT in the matrix file)
	      (Emiss will NOT line up at zero for delta different from zero)

	    * Re-do the matrix optimization without "00000" term. The new matrix should take care of aligning Emiss near zero.


After determining the SHMS momentum correction factor and aligning Emiss, How does W look?
 **  If W still appears a little off between DATA/SIMC, this is most likely due to the angle offset, dth_e, which W depends on.
     In this case, then the derivative (dW /dth_e), should tell the angle correction dth_e ( eyptar_offset) in order to align W.

     As an alternate method, one can also computue the electron angle using the formula: Eb = Pp * cos(th_p) + E'*cos(th_e_calc) 
     	   	     	     	     	  	       		      	    		 ---> Solve for th_e, and take the difference between (th_e_meas - th_e)
											     The offset should match that found using dW/dth
