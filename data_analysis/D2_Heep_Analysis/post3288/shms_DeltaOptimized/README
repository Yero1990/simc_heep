The SHMS Delta matrix has been optimized resutling in an improvement in Emiss
and W.

January 22, 2018

It was found that after optimizing the SHMS delta, the constant coefficient,

D0 =  -0.0175647222
Pcorr = P * (1 + D0) = 8.7 * (0.982435) = 8.547187

Problems where encountered when using this coefficient, as the SHMS delta was shifted, but when the same correction
was applied in the shmsflags.param, it was NOT. 

-----------------------------------------------------------

For now, it is better to compare Emiss_simc and Emiss_data, using the optimized shms delta matrix and the nominal SHMS P = 8.7
Then, since we know the HMS momentum and angle well, any shift in Emiss is attributed to the electron momentum.

Recall: Emiss (Eb, E', Ep)

Then, dEm = -dE' ,   where dEm = Em_simc - Em_data  (from fit)

E' corr = E' + dE' = E' - dEm =  E' (1 - dEm/E'),  where E' : uncorr. SHMS momentum
