Invariant Mass W Alignment Using H(e,e)p Elastics from Deuteron

-----------------
--Nov. 29, 2028--
-----------------
After checking out the HMS momentum to be OK, and optimizing SHMS delta,
There were improvements observed in Emiss. The W peak, however, had not yet
been aligned.  A comparison now is made between W_simc and W_data to
determine the momentum correction factor for SHMS.

A second iteration of delta Optimization should then be done.


The Variation in W with electron momentum is as follows:
dE' = -E' / Eb * dW,   dW =  W_simc - W_data

E'corr = E' + dE_corr = E' ( 1 - dW/Eb)  -->Multiply by ppcentral in kin file


Run     W_simc     W_data      (1 - dW/Eb)    E'corr
